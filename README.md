This is a small web application for calculating someone's reactio time which is developed using basic html,css and javascript. Basically there are four different color boxes present on the page. As soon as a user clicks on start button a randomly generated color from the 4 colors will be shown and the user will need to click on the box of that color. And when the number of rounds end an alert will be shown including average response time, correct answers and wrong answers.
